**Debugging Information**

- screenshot of the expanded Debug Information section of property inspector
- how recent is "Last State Change" in that section? - is it seconds, minutes, or hours?
- how frequently the 'last state change' is changing, if at all?

**Log File**
Attach (or copy-paste to gist.github.com) the debug log file (new).

hit win+r, then open %APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\logs - you want the most recent com.fredemmott.discord.... .log file (usually com.fredemmott.discord0.log).
Log file /might/ be in %APPDATA%\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\logs\ instead - this is what Elgato's documentation says.

On MacOS, this is ~/Library/Logs/StreamDeck/ instead.
