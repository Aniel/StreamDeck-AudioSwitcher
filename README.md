## Description

StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitch is a C++ plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck for switching
the default between two audio devices.

For example, this can be useful to switch between headphones and speakers if they are on different sound cards (e.g. USB speakers or USB headphones).

# Installation

Download the `com.fredemmott.audiooutputswitch.streamDeckPlugin` file from the releases page, and double-click it.

# Notes

This uses undocumented and unsupported Windows APIs. These have apparently worked since Windows 7, but they
might stop working at any time or have unexpected side effects.

# Thanks
